# Cisco Packet Tracer Network Project

## Project Overview
This Cisco Packet Tracer project demonstrates a hierarchical network topology designed to simulate a small to medium enterprise network environment. The network implements routing protocols, VLANs, and inter-network communication between multiple subnets.

## Network Topology

### Network Architecture
- **Hierarchical Design**: Three-layer network architecture (Access, Distribution, Core)
- **Routing Protocol**: Configured for inter-VLAN routing and subnet communication
- **Network Segments**: Multiple subnets with different IP addressing schemes

### Device Inventory

#### Routers
- **MainRouter** (192.168.40.0/25)
  - Central routing device
  - Handles inter-subnet communication
  - Gateway for multiple network segments

#### Switches
- **2960-24TT (Accounts)**: Access layer switch for accounting department
- **2960-24TT (Delivery)**: Access layer switch for delivery department

#### End Devices
- **PC-PT PC0**: Workstation in accounting network
- **PC-PT PC1**: Workstation in accounting network  
- **PC-PT PC2**: Workstation (192.168.40.128/25)
- **PC-PT PC3**: Workstation in delivery network
- **Printer-PT Printer0**: Network printer for accounting department
- **Printer-PT Printer1**: Network printer for delivery department

## IP Addressing Scheme

### Subnet Information
| Network Segment | IP Range | Subnet Mask | Gateway | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Main Network | 192.168.40.0/25 | 255.255.255.128 | 192.168.40.1 | Core network segment |
| Secondary Network | 192.168.40.128/25 | 255.255.255.128 | 192.168.40.129 | Secondary network segment |

### Device IP Assignments
- **PC2**: 192.168.40.128/25
- **Router Interface**: 192.168.40.0/25
- Additional device IPs configured according to subnet requirements

## Network Features

### Implemented Technologies
- **Inter-VLAN Routing**: Enables communication between different network segments
- **Static/Dynamic Routing**: Configured routing protocols for path determination
- **Network Segmentation**: Logical separation of departments (Accounts, Delivery)
- **Print Services**: Network-attached printers for departmental use

### Security Considerations
- Network segmentation provides security boundaries
- Router ACLs can be implemented for traffic filtering
- VLAN separation isolates broadcast domains

## Project Objectives

This network simulation demonstrates:
1. **Hierarchical Network Design**: Proper network layering and segmentation
2. **Routing Configuration**: Inter-subnet communication setup
3. **Network Services**: Print services and resource sharing
4. **Scalability**: Design allows for future network expansion
5. **Departmental Segregation**: Logical separation of business units

## Testing Scenarios

### Connectivity Tests
- [ ] PC-to-PC communication within same subnet
- [ ] PC-to-PC communication across subnets
- [ ] PC-to-Printer connectivity tests
- [ ] Router reachability verification
- [ ] Gateway functionality testing

### Network Services
- [ ] DHCP functionality (if configured)
- [ ] DNS resolution (if configured)
- [ ] Print services accessibility
- [ ] Network resource sharing

## Configuration Requirements

### Router Configuration
- Interface IP addressing
- Routing protocol configuration (RIP/OSPF/EIGRP)
- Static routes (if applicable)
- Gateway settings

### Switch Configuration
- VLAN creation and assignment
- Trunk port configuration
- Access port assignment
- Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

### End Device Configuration
- IP address assignment
- Subnet mask configuration
- Default gateway setup
- DNS settings (if applicable)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **No Connectivity**: Check IP addressing and subnet masks
2. **Inter-VLAN Issues**: Verify router configuration and VLAN setup
3. **Print Problems**: Confirm printer IP settings and network connectivity
4. **Routing Issues**: Check routing table and protocol configuration

### Diagnostic Commands
```
show ip route
show ip interface brief
show vlan brief
ping [destination_ip]
traceroute [destination_ip]
```
