# Enterprise Network Project 1 - Cisco Packet Tracer

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an enterprise network connecting two office locations using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network features VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, and site-to-site connectivity to simulate a real-world corporate network infrastructure.

## Network Architecture

### Network Topology
- **Two-site enterprise network** with interconnected offices
- **Hierarchical network design** with core, distribution, and access layers
- **VLAN segmentation** for different departments
- **Inter-site connectivity** using routers and switches

### IP Addressing Scheme
- **Site 1 Network**: 192.168.1.0/24
- **Site 2 Network**: 192.168.2.0/24
- **Inter-site Link**: 192.168.12.0/24

## VLAN Configuration

### Site 1 VLANs
- **VLAN 10 (HR)** - 192.168.40.0/24 - Cyan
- **VLAN 20 (Accounting)** - 192.168.40.0/24 - Yellow  
- **VLAN 30 (Public Relations)** - 192.168.40.0/24 - Green
- **VLAN 40 (Marketing)** - 192.168.40.0/24 - Magenta

### Site 2 VLANs
- Mirror configuration of Site 1 VLANs
- Same VLAN IDs for consistency across sites
- Color-coded for easy identification

## Device Configuration

### End Devices Per Site
- **16 PCs total** (8 per site)
- **4 VLANs per site** with 2 PCs each
- **Department-specific assignments**:
  - PC0-PC1: HR Department
  - PC2-PC3: Accounting Department  
  - PC4-PC5: Public Relations
  - PC6-PC7: Marketing

### Network Equipment
- **Core Routers**: ISR4331 for inter-site routing
- **Distribution Switches**: 2960 series with VLAN capabilities
- **Access Switches**: 2960-24TT for end device connectivity

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. VLAN Segmentation
- Isolated broadcast domains for each department
- Enhanced security through network segmentation
- Improved network performance and management

### 2. Inter-VLAN Routing
- Router-on-a-stick configuration
- Subinterfaces for each VLAN
- DHCP services for automatic IP assignment

### 3. Site-to-Site Connectivity
- Static routing between sites
- Redundant links for high availability
- Proper subnet planning for scalability

### 4. Network Services
- **DHCP**: Automatic IP address assignment
- **DNS**: Name resolution services
- **Inter-VLAN Communication**: Controlled access between departments

## Technologies Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Network simulation platform
- **Cisco IOS**: Router and switch operating system
- **VLANs**: Virtual Local Area Networks
- **STP**: Spanning Tree Protocol for loop prevention
- **Static Routing**: Manual route configuration
- **DHCP**: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

## Configuration Highlights

### Switch Configuration
```cisco
# VLAN Creation
vlan 10
 name HR
vlan 20
 name ACCOUNTING
vlan 30
 name PUBLIC_RELATIONS
vlan 40
 name MARKETING

# Port Assignment
interface fastethernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
```

### Router Configuration
```cisco
# Subinterface Configuration
interface gigabitethernet0/0.10
 encapsulation dot1q 10
 ip address 192.168.40.1 255.255.255.0

# Inter-site Routing
ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.12.2
```

## Network Performance

### Metrics Achieved
- **Zero packet loss** between sites
- **Sub-second convergence** time
